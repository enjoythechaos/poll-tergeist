Review code:
  get rid of console.log, alert, and debugger statements
  have a very careful look at comments
  look for functions that are never called by other functions
    - colortest controller
    - update_batch now in answerChoices
  fix databases - get rid of unneeded columns, not nulls, etc.
    - letter isn't really being used in AnswerChoice
    - respondent_id isn't really being used in Responses
  bring guest data creation code into a new file.
  there is a big-ass bug having to do with dependent destroy.
